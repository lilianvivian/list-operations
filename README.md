# List Operations in Python

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates basic list operations using Python.

## 📄 Description

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`
2. Appends the values: `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40`
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. Removes the last element from the list
6. Sorts the list in ascending order
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
The index of 30 in the sorted list is: 3
```

## 💡 Learning Objective

This exercise helps reinforce understanding of:
- List methods (`append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `index()`)
- Indexing and basic Python syntax

## 📁 File

- `list_operations.py`: Contains the complete code for the list manipulation
